    <p> George Lucas thought that the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han cold blooded. Let's think about the original scene, shall we? Greedo, the bounty hunter, is holding Han at gun point and says in his gurgley voice, "He is going to kill him." Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
